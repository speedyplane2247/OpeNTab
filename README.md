## Tracking
As you may or may not know, a beta adds a tracking functionallity. This is purely for statistics, and I am using a bit.ly URL, so I do not have access to the IPs. I do this so I know when a version is obselete. They all point to a non-exist subdomain on my website. If you aren't comfortable with this, you can enable "Do Not Track" in your browser to block these. You can also use doNotTrack(); to cancel tracking.
